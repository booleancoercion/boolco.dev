The code for my (joke) website.

Even though I haven't taken the content seriously, I actually put in a lot of attention to detail - you see, when you share your website with programmers, you're going to get a lot of pen testers whether you like it or not :)

Feel free to poke around and try to mess with it, I dare you!
